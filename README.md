## Play the game

If your operating system allows, download the latest AppImage from [Releases](https://github.com/ZirixCZ/FootballKicker/releases).
If not, choose either the *local* or *Manual build* approach listed below.

### Local

To run the game locally, you have to clone the repository or download the source code from releases.
Then install all dependencies with `npm install` considering you've got node installed. Then run `npm run start` to start the application.

## Manual build

To build the game for yourself, git clone the repository, install dependencies and run `npm run dist`. This will automatically build the application for your operating system.
